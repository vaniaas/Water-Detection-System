# Water Detection System â€“ Arduino Project  

This repository contains the **Water Detection System** using **Arduino**, designed to detect water presence and control a **servo motor** accordingly. 

## Features  
- **Water Detection:** Uses a sensor to determine if water is present.  
- **Servo Control:** Rotates the servo motor based on sensor readings.  
- **Serial Monitoring:** Displays real-time status in the Serial Monitor.  

## Wiring  

### Sensor  
- `Signal` â†’ Pin **2**  
- `VCC` â†’ **5V**  
- `GND` â†’ **GND**  

### Servo Motor  
- `Signal` â†’ Pin **9**  
- `VCC` â†’ **5V**  
- `GND` â†’ **GND**  

## Usage  
1. Connect the **water sensor** and **servo motor** as per the wiring guide.  
2. Upload the provided **Arduino code** to your board.  
3. Monitor water detection output via the **Serial Monitor**.  
4. The **servo motor** will adjust based on water presence.
